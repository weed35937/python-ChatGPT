# Website to GPT 🌐➡️📝

A Python tool that converts your website content into GPT-friendly text files by scraping your sitemap. This tool is particularly useful for creating training data or knowledge bases for GPT models from your website content.

## Overview 🔍

Website to GPT automatically scrapes all pages listed in your website's sitemap.xml and converts them into clean text format. It handles JavaScript-rendered content and offers two output options:
- Individual text files for each page
- A single merged file with clear page separators
